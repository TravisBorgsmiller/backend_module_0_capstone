## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.  
A conditional statement is where your code will take different paths based on parameters   that are set. Contional statement examples are if, else, and elseif.  
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?  
If you had a situation where you wanted to print out code or run a result based on   something being true, and if it was false then you would prefer that code not be ran.  
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?  
if #insert parameters   
  #insert code to be ran   
else   
  #insert code to be ran   
end   

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?   
with "elseif"   
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?   
if #insert parameters   
  #insert code to be ran   
elseif   
  #insert code to be ran   
else   
  #insert code to be ran   
end  
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?  
You could use the unless conditional, which would execute only if the conditional is false
